# LeagueOfLegendsRandomComposition

## *The idea for this project came from a need my friend and I had. During our evening game sessions, we sometimes get bored and want to add some excitement to our games!* 

*So I created a **composition** randomizer. It generates **five champions**and a list of **items** you must purchase during the game.*

This is the main page. Before generating, it displays the lanes and the container where the items will appear :

Then, when you click **"Generate a Team Composition"**, five champions are generated, each with a pair of boots, a support item for the support role, and additional items to fill the available slots.

If you're not a hardcore gamer and want a composition that better suits what you want to play, you can simply reroll by pressing **"Generate a Team Composition"** again!
